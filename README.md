# TO DO
1. The checkphase thing for simulation drain time
2. comment the code
3. test out txt file readability
4. Does randomization of seed actually work? I'm not sure, need to test it

5. the tailer and invalid are predefined in the noc_pkt.sv. We need to ensure that those values are sent via the files?
